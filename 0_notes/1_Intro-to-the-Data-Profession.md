# Introduction to the Data Profession

## Functions within the Data Space 

These four functions work together to generate business calue from data. 

* Data science 
* Data engineering 
* Data analytics
* Buisness intelligence

Note: Don't try to focus on all areas at once. 

## Why we need clarity 

* Be deliberate about what you want.
* Less confusion, more results

## Data Science 

Data science is the systematic study of the structure and behavior of data in order to quatifiably undertand past and current occurrences, as well as predict the future behavior of that data. 

### Typical Traits

* Degree in a quantitative field. 
* Programmers (should know R and python)
* Curious and tenacious personalities. 
* Previous experience: BI reporting, data analysis, and data-driven decision-making. 
* Interested in why over how. (looking to make predictions)

### Typical Tasks 

* Spends hours analysing complex questions. 
* Data scientist derive insights from data, including big data (data from engineered systems). 
* Uncover correlations and causations in business data to support business decision-making.
* These people generate predictions from data and communicate predictions through data visualization. 

### Typical Competencies

* STEM degree, with advanced math. 
* Coding: Python, R, SQL, Spark, machine learning 

## Data Engineering 

Data engineering is the design, consturciton, and maintencance of data systems. 

### Typical Traits

* Programmers 
* Good in maht, but don't use statistics much.
* Previous experience: database architect, ETL (Extract Transfrom and Loan) developer (move database from one storage system to another), database developer, security architect, etc. 
* Prefer to design and build IT systems rather than to analyze data. 
* Interested in how over why. 

### Typical Tasks 

* Data engineers design systems to collect, handle, and store big datasets.
* Data engineers build modular, scalable platforms for data processing. 
* These people design, build, and maintain systems that store and move big data. 

### Typical Competencies

* Computer science, software engineering
* Coding: Java, C++, Python 

## Data Analytics

Data analytics are data prducts that describe data and how it behaves. These data products are generated from data analysis and visualization processes. 

### Typical Traits 

* Use applications to analyze data. 
* Solid in basic math. 
* Understand the inner workings of a business very well. 
* Enjoy using data insights to improve business. 
* Not into deep analyses. 

### Typical Tasks

* Generates predictive, prescriptive, and descriptive data insights. 
* Uncovers correlations and causations in business data to support business decision-making. 
* Deploys analytics technologies: anlytis software applications. 

# The Four Flavors of Data Science

* Data analysis
* Data science
* Artificial intelligence 
* Deep learning

## Data Analysis

* Data analysis is a process for making sense of data
* Data analysis could include data cleaning, reformatting, and recombing data. 
* Data analysis is carried out with the express intention of discovering trends, patterns, and fidnings in data that describe real-life phenomenon. 

## Data Science 

Data science is the systematic study of the structure and behavior of data in order to quatifiably undertand past and current occurrences, as well as predict the future behavior of that data. 

## Artificial Intelligence

A machine or application with the capacity to autonomously execute upon preditions it makes from data. 

### Two elements

1. Prediction - predictive modeling (from data science)
2. Execution - autonomous response (from engineering)

## Deep Learning

Deep learning is a set of predictive methodologies that borrows its structure from the neural network structures of the brain. This class of methods is particularly effective for making predictions from big data. 

Deep learning is a sub-field within data science, and it can be used as a decision model with applications to product deep learning AI. 

# Why use Python for Analytics? 

* Python is a high-level, interpreted coding language that is useful for a wide variety of applications.
* Python is one of the official programming languages of Google. 

## Benefits

* Easy to learn, human readable.
* Extensive array of well-supported data science libraries.
* Biggest user base of all data science languages. 
* Useful in data engineering. 

## Python is useful for: 

* Data science, data analytics, and data engineering 
* Useful in both professional and an academic enviroment.
* Python is an open-source programming language.
* Web development
* Application development
* Game development

## Main Libraries for Data Science

Advanced Data Analysis:

* NumPy
* SciPy
* pandas

Data Visualization

* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

Machine Learning 

* scikit-learn
* TensorFlow
* Keras
