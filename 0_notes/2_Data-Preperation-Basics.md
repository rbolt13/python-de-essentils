# Filtering and Selecting 

## Introducing the pandas Library

* Why pandas - fast data cleaning, preparation, and analysis; easy to use for data visualization and machine learning. 
* What is pandas - built on top of NumPy, makes it easy to work with arrays and matrices (called series and data frames).
