# Practical Data Visualization 

# Creating standard data graphics

## Charts 

### Line Chart

* Show the change in value of an attribute with respect to a x-variable (which is often "time")
* Can be used to visually compare the values of several related attributes

### Bar Chart

* Represents data attribute values within a particular data category by using bars of differing heights 
* Bar charts represent observation counts within categories

### Pie Chart

* Represents data attribute values using a circle and slices that comprise it
* A whole and entire set of categorical data is represented by the complete circle, and the proportions of observations that fall into the different categories are represented by proportionate pie slices. 

## Two Methods for Plot Building 

* Functional method: build plot by calling the plotting function on a variable or set of variables. 
* Object-oriented method: build plot by generating a blank figure object and then populating that object with a plot and plot elements. 

## Popular Data Visualizations Libraries in Python

* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
