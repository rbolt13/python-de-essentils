# Data Visualization 101

# Three types of Data Visualization 

1. Data storytelling - for presentations to organizational decision makers. 

2. Data showcasing - for presentations to analysts, scientist, mathematicians, and engineers.

3. Data art - for presentations to activists or to the general public. 

## Data Storytelling 

Make it easy for the audience to get the point.

Your data visualization should be:

* Clutter-free
* Highly focused

Intended audience:

* Nonanalysts 
* Nontechnical business managers

Product types:

* Static images 
* Simple interactive dashboards

Example:

## Data Showcasing 

Showcase lots of data so your audience members can think for themselves. 

Your data visualization should be:

* Highly contextual
* Open ended 

Intended audience:

* Analyzts, quants 
* Engineers, mathematicians, scientists

Product Types

* Static images
* Interactive dashboards

## Displaying Data Art

Use your data visulaization to make a statement

Your data visualization should be:

* Attention getting
* Creative, controversial

Intended audience:

* Idealists, dreamers, artists
* Social activists

Product types:

* Static images

# Choosing Graphics 

## Choosing Graphics for Data Storytelling

* Area charts
* Bar charts
* Line charts
* Pie charts
* Choropleth Map: show area boundries.
* Point Maps: show points. 

## Choosing Graphics for Data Showcasing 

* Area charts 
* Bar charts
* Line charts
* Cloropleths
* Point Maps
* Histograms
* Scatter Plots 
* Scatter Plot Matricies
* Raster Maps: X and Y grid filled in with color values according to count. 

## Choosing Graphics for Data Art

* Line charts
* Graphic Networks
* Cloropleths
* Something Weird and Artistic...

Four Steps to Choosing Data Graphics

1. Make a list of the questions that your data visualization is meant to answer.
2. Is your data visualization type data storytelling, data showcasing, or data art?
3. What data graphic types are preferable for that type of data visualization?
4. Test out different types of data graphics with your data. Which graphic type displays the most clear and obvious answers to your questions? 

Testing Out Data Graphics

* The two data graphics below represent the same statistic. Notice how the data graphic  on the right does a much better job of visually emphasizing the difference in values?
* You should always test different data graphics, to make sure that you use the one that most clearly and effectively displays your data. The graphic below and to the left is not effective.

# Communicating with color and Context

## Creating Context with Color

**Color should be used:**

* Strategically
* Sparingly
* Consistently

**You want to use color to draw attention to the parts of the visualization that matter, and away from the parts that don't.**

## Choose Consistent Colors

Your shades should all be from the same color formula. Options include monochromatic, analogous, complimentary, split complimentary, triadic, tetradic - based on color theory.

## Annotations as Context

* Provide your audience some information about why data is as it is.
* Useful in data storytelling and data showcasing

## Graphic Elements as Context

* Help your audience understand the relative significance of the data you're showing them.
* Trendlines, single-value alerts, and benchmarks. 

## Creating Context

* How: add data on additional metricies that are relevent to the datasets you're showing, trendlines, colors, and annotations
* Why: meant to give audience some deeper perspective and insights into what's happening
* When: useful in data showcasing
